Responsible Load Testing
Instead of writing a custom script to simulate high traffic, consider using dedicated load-testing tools. These tools are designed to simulate realistic traffic while remaining ethical and compliant.

Recommended Tools
Apache JMeter: Open-source tool for performance and load testing.

Create HTTP requests to simulate multiple users.
Measure server response times and throughput.
Locust: A Python-based load-testing tool.

Write Python code to define user behaviors.
Simulate thousands of users concurrently.
Loader.io or BlazeMeter: Cloud-based load-testing platforms.

Easy-to-use web interfaces.
Minimal setup required.
Example Using Locust
Hereâ€™s how you can use Locust to test traffic on your GoDaddy-hosted domain:

Install Locust:
pip install locust
Create a Test Script: Save this as locustfile.py:

from locust import HttpUser, task, between

class WebsiteUser(HttpUser):
    wait_time = between(1, 5)  # Simulate user waiting between requests

    @task
    def home_page(self):
        self.client.get("/")  # Replace with specific paths if needed


Run Locust:
locust -f locustfile.py --host=https://www.re-chakra.com


Access the Locust Web Interface:

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:8089.
Set the number of users and spawn rate to simulate traffic.
Benefits of Using Tools
Ethical and Controlled: Designed for testing without malicious intent.
Compliant: Can throttle traffic to prevent server overload.
Insights: Generate detailed reports on server performance.


To use a different port with Locust, you can specify the desired port when running the locust command using the --web-port flag.
locust -f locustfile.py --host=https://www.re-chakra.com --web-port=8000
